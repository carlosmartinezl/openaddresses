#summary Before synchronizing data with OSM, plausibility checks must be performed.

= Introduction =

Before synchronizing data with OSM, plausibility checks must be performed. These checks should also take place before uploading data.
This functionality should therefore be available before the data upload functionality is implemented.


= Details =

As it is impossible to check every address, one should define some patterns to be applied to all address data to make sure that the addresses are likely to be correct.

All addresses that fail the test must be manually checked and corrected before they can be uploaded.
?? Should automatic correction be performed for some cases ? ??

Some ideas:
 * define the coordinate bounding box for each country. The address' coordinates msut be inside of the pre-defined bounding box.
 * Street Name never contain numbers
 * Perform Spelling checks (Stret, strett, ...)
