=== KVP parameters ===

 * no_geom=true: so that the returned feature has no geometry ("geometry": null)
 * attrs={field1}[,{field2},...]: to restrict the list of properties returned in the feature 
 * limit={num}: limit the number of features to num  features
 * offset={num}: skip num features
 * order_by={field}: order the features using field
 * dir=DESC|ASC: determine the ordering direction (applies only if order_by is specified) 
 * lon={x}: the x coordinate of the center of the search region, this coord's projection system can be specified with the epsg parameter
 * lat={y}: the y coordinate of the center of the search region, this coord's projection system can be specified with the epsg parameter
 * tolerance={num}: the tolerance around the center of the search region, expressed in the units of the lon/lat coords' projection system
 * box={xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax}: a list of coordinates representing a bounding box, the coords' projection system can be specified with the epsg parameter
 * epsg={num}: the EPSG code of the lon, lat or box values 
 * queryable={field1}[,{field2},...]}: the names of the feature fields that can be queried
 * {field}__{query_op}={value}: specify a filter expression, field must be in the list of fields specified by queryable, supported query_op's are:
  * eq: equal to
  * ne: not equal to
  * lt: lower than
  * le: lower than or equal to
  * gt: greater than
  * ge: greater than or equal to
  * like
  * ilike
 * query: string to search for Use a full text search. To be used with attrs key.
 * callback: name of callback function

==== Response ====

 [http://geojson.org/ GeoJSON] data are sent back.  

==== Hints ====

 * Use *street* or *street,city,housnumber* as attrs. Database is optimized for these fields.
 * Try to always add a spatial filter for maximum performance

=== !GeoCoding Service ===

==== Examples ====
 * Get three addresses of Genève containing Vogt 
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?limit=3&attrs=street,housenumber,city&query=Gen%E8ve%20Vogt
 * Get three addresses of Genève containing Vogt, with callback 
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?limit=3&attrs=street,housenumber,city&query=Gen%E8ve%20Vogt&callback=myCallback
 * Get the coordinate of the address of "Chemin des Fleurettes 31" in "Lausanne"
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?queryable=city,housenumber,street&city__ilike=%Lausanne%&housenumber__like=31&street__ilike=%Chemin%20Des%20Fleurettes% 
 * Extract the first three addresses in the city of "Lausanne" and return only the street, housenumber and city attribute, without geometry.
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?limit=3&&queryable=city&city__ilike=Lausanne&attrs=street,housenumber,city&no_geom=true
 * Extract the addresses near a point with a specific name:
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?lon=6.62&lat=46.51&tolerance=0.01&queryable=street&street__ilike=%Chemin%20du%20M%

=== Reverse !GeoCoding Service ===

==== Examples ====

===== !MapFish Reverse !GeoCoding Service =====

 * Extract all the addresses in a tolerance of 1000 m around coordinate 600'000/200'000 of Switzerland EPSG=21781. Return geometry is in EPSG:4326
  * http://www.openaddresses.org/addresses/?lon=600000&lat=200000&tolerance=1000&epsg=21781
