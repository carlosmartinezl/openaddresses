 1. On Test: global osm export
 1. On Test: creation of INSERT SQL Script
 1. On Test: start SQL Script
 1. On Test: user validation
 1. On Prod: import SQL script
 1. On Prod: delete osm data based on osmid
 1. On Prod: start SQL Script

==== Incremental load ====

 1. On Test: weekly cron:
  1. On Test: Export differential OSM file based on last changeset
  1. On Test: Creation of INSERT - UPDATE - DELETE SQL Script
